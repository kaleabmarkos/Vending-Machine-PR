# Vending-Machine-PR
Vending Machine Simulator Overview This repository contains the source code and documentation for a Vending Machine Simulator implemented in SystemVerilog.
The project aims to demonstrate the functionality of a simple vending machine that accepts different coin denominations, dispenses rotten tomatoes, provides
change, and displays the current state and amount of change on 7-segment displays.

Features Accepts Farthing (0.25d), Ha'penny (0.5d), and Penny (1d) coins. Implements a finite state machine (FSM) for state management.
Dispenses rotten tomatoes as a humorous output. Provides change in the form of farthings and ha'pennies. Utilizes 7-segment displays for 
clear user feedback. Includes detailed documentation explaining the design and implementation.
